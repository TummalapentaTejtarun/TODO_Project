# TODO List

A small, vanilla JavaScript TODO list web app consisting of a single HTML page, stylesheet, and script.

## Project files

- `Todo.html` — main HTML page (open in a browser)
- `Todo.css` — styles for the app
- `Todo.js` — JavaScript behavior (add / remove / toggle tasks)

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Remove tasks

## Usage

1. Open `Todo.html` in your browser (double-click or open from your browser's File > Open).
2. Optionally run a local server for development:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# then visit http://localhost:8000/Todo.html
```

## Development

- Edit `Todo.html`, `Todo.css`, and `Todo.js` to modify UI and behavior.
- If you add build steps or dependencies, include instructions here.
